<h3 id="The-Problem"><a href="#The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="The Problem"></a>The <strong>Problem</strong></h3><p>Being a college student I always faced the issue that while doing something like<br>assignment when I used to start chatting with somebody regarding it I always<br>ended up spending hours scrolling timeline which always resulted in making me<br>lag behind in time and thus creating last minute fuss.</p>
<p>So to solve this problem I decided why not to make the timeline and<br>notifications itself get disabled. Another problem everybody could relate to was<br>the incredibly complicated unused daily things that appear on facebook.</p>
<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/PsGZEKpj1pSNy/giphy.gif" alt=""></div>
<h3 id="Solution"><a href="#Solution" class="headerlink" title="Solution"></a>Solution</h3><p>So to solve these issues I ended up making Pelican with two modes namely focus<br>and minimal mode.</p>
<h4 id="Minimal-Mode"><a href="#Minimal-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Minimal Mode"></a>Minimal Mode</h4><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Minimal mode is designed to solve the other issue of getting rid from the not so<br>useful things on Facebook. Moreover, being a big fan of minimalism my main goal<br>of this was to make the Facebook minimal. Thus, I ended up deleting everything<br>except the news feed and chat, as they were the reason because of which I use to<br>open Facebook 90% of the time.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iLLOqgB6pl_C0x95L__xkQ.png" alt=""><br><span class="figcaption_hack">Minimal Mode</span></p>
<h4 id="Focus-Mode"><a href="#Focus-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Focus Mode"></a>Focus Mode</h4><blockquote>
<p>“Lack of direction, not lack of time, is the problem. We all have twenty-four<br>hour days.” ― <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/50316.Zig_Ziglar" target="_blank" rel="external">Zig Ziglar</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Focus mode is designed in a way that you don’t get notifications for messages<br>and other things and furthermore timeline is also disabled thus letting the<br>person stay focused on the task in hand. To further give motivation to work I<br>Quotes and unsplash image are added in focus mode.</p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/o3xmL-TqK5o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><span class="figcaption_hack">Video on Anna</span></p>
<p>The video you see above is of Anna Assistant a virtual assistant for google<br>chrome which i had been working on with a couple of people for the past few<br>months.</p>
<h3 id="How-it-all-started"><a href="#How-it-all-started" class="headerlink" title="How it all started ?"></a>How it all started ?</h3><p>Anna was nothing more than a hack made in 17 hours for a hackathon in college<br>organised at the end of October 2017.</p>
<h3 id="Idea"><a href="#Idea" class="headerlink" title="Idea"></a>Idea</h3><p>Being a Linux user, I was always in a search of good virtual assistant which I<br>could actually play with every time. The once I found were giving me a hard time<br>to install and always ended up making my life miserable for a couple of days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus my search for a good virtual assistant was even more than my search for a<br>girlfriend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So because of this only, when the time to decide what to make for hackathon we<br>decided to make an assistant ourselves which could fulfill. Thus I and my team<br>ended up deciding to make a virtual assistant for Linux. But the sad truth we<br>soon realised was that we won’t be able to show our assistant to family and<br>normal friends (yaa, because 4 years of engineering makes you insane) as they<br>are not familiar with the Linux world.</p>
<p>So the very next thought was why not to make a chrome extension. This idea was<br>sounding good as by doing this we could end up covering all platforms and could<br>fulfill most of the needs of a user by just using chrome browser. Further<br>considering the fact that chrome is one of the most widely and easy to use<br>browser we decided to start hacking it.</p>
<h3 id="The-Hack"><a href="#The-Hack" class="headerlink" title="The Hack"></a>The Hack</h3><p>So now we were having an awesome idea, a motivation to make but the question was<br>how to make?</p>
<p>This is and will always stay the hardest part of any hack, to decide what to<br>use.</p>
<p>After considering a lot of options and finding their shortcomings we decided<br>that we will do something like taking the voice from the user, convert it to<br>text and then write If conditions.</p>
<p>But it was a very bad idea. 😃 😺</p>
<p>So after further thinking, we decided that we will put AI/NLP in the part where<br>it gets to decide if conditions. As of how can you even think to win a hackathon<br>by just writing if conditions for 17 hours.</p>
<p>Then came the dialogflow/api.ai into play. So now we had a plan something like<br>this:</p>
<p>Speech -&gt; Text -&gt; dialogflow -&gt; actions triggered by API’s</p>
<p>Then hacking began</p>
<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/JIX9t2j0ZTN9S/giphy.gif" alt=""></div>
<p>In the end, we were able to implement a decent hack, though having very minimal<br>features such as opening websites, playing songs from YouTube, writing an email,<br>tweeting etc. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bVrAZMgEY" target="_blank" rel="external">Demo video of the Hack on<br>Youtube</a></p>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/17bVrAZMgEY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><span class="figcaption_hack">Demo video of hack.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a decent hack. Not the best and we got third. I was like okay 😿</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="The-decision"><a href="#The-decision" class="headerlink" title="The decision"></a>The decision</h3><p>Till this time everything I made in my life, just went on GitHub and stayed on<br>my not at all visited by anyone GitHub account.</p>
<p>But this time, I wanted to make something which I can ship. So I decided to<br>feature it on chrome web store and show it to the world.</p>
<p>If you are an Indian you could easily relate to the pain of putting something on<br>Chrome web store. Not due to the cash, but because you need a credit card. Yes,<br>they don’t accept Indian Debit cards. This made me roam around and go to all my<br>friends to get one.</p>
<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/CNjCfUhoCg5IA/giphy.gif" alt=""></div>
<p><span class="figcaption_hack">Me and Chrome web store paying</span></p>
<p>So finally i put it on <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/anna-assistant/kmkkgdkinnjokklbfloikdbdohbiklog" target="_blank" rel="external">Chrome web<br>store</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Accidental-Fame"><a href="#Accidental-Fame" class="headerlink" title="Accidental Fame"></a>Accidental Fame</h3><p>Being a bit excited about it I showed it to a couple of my friends and also made<br>a lame Facebook post which few people liked. But yes it was just a one day show<br>and soon ended.</p>
<p>I thought it was over, but after a couple of weeks when one day I was looking at<br>the number of downloads I realised that they went suddenly high. Being curious<br>about it, after checking Google analytics I discovered that traffic was coming<br>from this blog.</p>
<p><a href="http://techpp.com/2017/11/10/anna-assistant-voice-assistant-chrome/?ref=producthunt" target="_blank" rel="external">http://techpp.com/2017/11/10/anna-assistant-voice-assistant-chrome/</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ZDAarVyDvvB--IPl." alt=""><br><span class="figcaption_hack">One of the first articles about anna</span></p>
<p>Soon I realized that a lot of blogs are written about Anna and even Anna is<br>being said to be Siri or Cortana of Chrome. For a college kid having nothing<br>being featured anywhere, it was a big thing.</p>
<p>But now I started feeling bad about our logo. It was crap. It was something I<br>just ended up making in two minutes. And I was not even having proper posters to<br>put on Chrome web store. Only thing I had was a video explaining its features<br>that was made for demo purpose during the hackathon.</p>
<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/LqafmeaBVxCRG/giphy.gif" alt=""></div>
<p>So i decided to work on it for a couple more weeks.</p>
<h3 id="Open-Source-Development"><a href="#Open-Source-Development" class="headerlink" title="Open Source Development"></a>Open Source Development</h3><p>The code was open sourced from the very beginning. I decided to enter into a<br>month of coding Open Source event with Anna which was known as KWOC. With the<br>help of 2–3 contributors who started showing interest in Anna we improved its<br>functionalities and made Anna a more handy extension.</p>
<p>Presently it is having more than 20 different functionalities, reverse search<br>being my personal favorite. Could also be seen in the promotional video<br>attached(The First video).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*UDV_WX6ZE-_V5uNx." alt=""><br><span class="figcaption_hack">Actions that Anna can do now</span></p>
<p>The best part about Anna is that it works in the background thus giving no<br>random animations or pop-ups. But soon we realised that it should have a status<br>icon or something so that user can know if it is working or not. So we decided<br>to add a very minimal and small status icon which could be easily enabled or<br>disabled by the user.</p>
<h3 id="Branding"><a href="#Branding" class="headerlink" title="Branding"></a>Branding</h3><p>So with Anna gaining popularity, one day when I was at my friend’s house we<br>decided to give our assistant a completely new look and started branding Anna<br>from head to toe. With this Anna got a new logo and became more like a real<br>voice assistant.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HeyhPYJoGxTmGN0d." alt=""><br><span class="figcaption_hack">Anna’s new logo</span></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*XSskaJuEyMa9fO_P." alt=""></p>
<p>We decided to go with elephant as Anna’s logo. Since Anna means Elephant in<br>Malayalam. And i wanted have the logo like an emoji. 🐘</p>
<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xULW8pWyXEwmkHPPJS/giphy.gif" alt=""></div>
<h3 id="Product-hunt-release-of-Anna"><a href="#Product-hunt-release-of-Anna" class="headerlink" title="Product hunt release of Anna"></a>Product hunt release of Anna</h3><p>One of the milestones in Anna’s achievements was its release on Product Hunt.<br>Soon it became the third product of the day with 327 upvotes.</p>
<p>It went from a project that could be made by anybody in a couple of hours to a<br>project that is actually a Product.</p>
<p>I wasn’t even having a proper product hunt account at the time I released it<br>there. You need to do some tasks to be able to ship products on product hunt.<br>The only time I visited product hunt before this was when one of my friends<br>asked me to upvote his product on product hunt.</p>
<p>Now I realize how amazing it was to put Anna on product hunt. After this, more<br>and more blogs and articles were written on Anna and Anna got new users. My<br>inbox was now filled with mails about Anna and it was really so satisfying to<br>see that people were showing interest in it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*-ePPT0_RB-gfr7EH." alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, after being the 3rd product of the day on product hunt I saw this tweet<br>by the product hunt itself.😃 Though Anna has a lot of tweets, still this is my<br>favourite.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WYLcKi8JLhXueWlQkhbShQ.png" alt=""><br><span class="figcaption_hack">The Best tweet i ever had</span></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*sf-XnQjC8_IsmdW6." alt=""></p>
<p>Even without much marketing, Anna is able to secure a place in 10 + blogs all<br>being organic.Some of the articles about Anna are:</p>

<p>As what else could be better for promoting Anna than the online platform twitter<br>itself. Thus Anna has an active twitter handle to tell the world about what it<br>can do and what people are saying about it.</p>

<h3 id="Future"><a href="#Future" class="headerlink" title="Future"></a>Future</h3><p>We are planning to make Anna for Firefox also. Work in this direction has<br>already been started it is just we cannot realise it completely due to lack of<br>support by Mozilla in voice recognition. I guess, it will hardly take one or two<br>more months to get resolved.</p>
<h3 id="Thank-you"><a href="#Thank-you" class="headerlink" title="Thank you"></a>Thank you</h3><p>Thank you for reading this. After doing this i learned two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always ship; don’t think too much.</li>
<li>Make a product; hacks are just for fun.</li>
</ol>
<p>With this, I decided to make more and more products so that I could look at them<br>and proudly say that this is made by me and also get a new topic to write a blog<br>on.😃 ⛅️</p>

<p>PyTorch was rewritten and tailored to be fast and feel native in Python. PyTorch is not a Python binding into a monolothic C++ framework. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Computation is defined runtime</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like most python code,while TensorFlow other framework requires the user to define the model first and then compute it. TensorFlow was made for Engineers while PyTorch was for researchrs.</p>
<p>Meaning PyTorch is more flexible with the prize of a little drop in efficency.</p>

<p>Once you are done, all you need to do is call #backward() on the result. This will calculate the gradients and you will be able to access them for Variables that were created with requires_grad = True.</p>

<p>PyTorch is still a young framework which is getting momentum fast. You may find it a good fit if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do research or your production non-functional requirements are not very demanding</li>
<li>Want better development and debugging experience</li>
<li>Love all things Pythonic</li>
</ul>
<p>TensorFlow is a good option if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop models for production</li>
<li>Develop models which need to be deployed on mobile platforms</li>
<li>Want good community support and comprehensive documentation</li>
<li>Want rich learning resources in various forms (TensorFlow has an an entire MOOC)</li>
<li>Want or need to use Tensorboard</li>
<li>Need to use large-scale distributed model training</li>
</ul>
<p>But if you are still very new to Deeplearning and would just like to know what it means, keras is the way to go. </p>
<h1 id="Learn-More"><a href="#Learn-More" class="headerlink" title="Learn More"></a>Learn More</h1><p>If you are a developer and wants to learn pytorch and deeplearning, i suggest this course <a href="http://www.fast.ai/" target="_blank" rel="external">Fast.ai</a></p>

<p>Applying <a href="https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN" target="_blank" rel="external">CycleGan</a>for Audio texture synthesis and Style Transfer. </p>
<p>Normally CycleGAN gives you epic results <a href="https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/" target="_blank" rel="external">like</a> the one below</p>
 <div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN/raw/master/imgs/horse2zebra.gif" alt=""></div>
<p>So we liked the idea of replacing an object in an image by another. </p>
<p>So these are our image outputs : -</p>
<div class="figure fig-50" style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="image11.png" alt=""></div><div class="figure fig-50" style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="image8.gif" alt=""></div><div class="figure fig-50" style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="image9.gif" alt=""></div>
<p>Apple to Oranges and vice versa.</p>
<p>Well not all were bad, but some were pretty awful.</p>
<p>So we decided to apply this idea in another domain. AUDIO.</p>
<p>Wait wait….</p>
<p>Lets look at cycleGan first<br><div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="image6.png" alt=""></div></p>
<p>Basic idea is you have image of one style ,you copy that style to another.</p>
<p>(Yeah like the Prisma App which was viral some time ago).</p>
<p>Cool thing is you only need unpaired image samples. </p>
<p>So google with a simple google search you can make your own Dataset.</p>
<p>If you wanna know more read the paper. In short it has a Cyclic loss with the Adversarial loss with Two Generators and Two Discriminators.</p>
<h1 id="Tweak"><a href="#Tweak" class="headerlink" title="Tweak"></a>Tweak</h1><p>Lets convert audio to image and apply the same thing. </p>
<p>We first chose midi file, But the results were not that great.<br>So instead we used Spectrogram. </p>
<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="image15.png" alt=""></div>
<p>So we convert audio to greyscale Spectrogram Image. And two sets of these images were used as the datasample.</p>
<p>Steps</p>
<ul>
<li>Take two 20 second audio sample.</li>
<li>Slice them upto into 4 images of 5 seconds each (512px x 512px)</li>
<li>Apply to model</li>
<li>Use the outputs and restore it back.</li>
</ul>
<p>We got this.</p>
<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="image16.png" alt=""></div>
<p>a) Style 1<br>b) Style 2 applied on Style 1<br>c) Style 2<br>d) Style 1 applied on Style 2</p>
<h1 id="Results"><a href="#Results" class="headerlink" title="Results"></a>Results</h1><h2 id="Inputs"><a href="#Inputs" class="headerlink" title="Inputs"></a>Inputs</h2><p>Style 1 </p>

<p>Well it gets good at some point of training then it starts producing results which will rip your ear off again.So this is around the place where it is at its optimum. </p>
<p>Good news is its works. </p>
<p>If you make a better network it will give you better results and maybe apply some noise filter. </p>
<h2 id="Some-Future-Tweaks"><a href="#Some-Future-Tweaks" class="headerlink" title="Some Future Tweaks"></a>Some Future Tweaks</h2><ul>
<li>InputAudio -&gt; Tweaked CycleGAN -&gt; OutputAudio (Well its almost same), using librosa for audio input.</li>
<li>Use RGB instead of GreyScale.</li>
<li>Apply on DiscoGAN and compare results. </li>
</ul>
<p>Now look at this epic tiget to panther conversion. </p>

<p>I couldn’t find a good bechmark, if you have an idea of one. Please comment below.<br>If you have some intersting ideas comment below. Lets try some stuff.</p>
<p>I would like to thanks Ankit Petkar and Amrit Daimary for their valuable contrubtions.<br>Thanks you for Reading.  </p>]]></content>

Why not any other name</h1><p>Nybles or Nibble is a unit of information. 4 bits or 0.5 byte is a Nibble or a Nyble. Well we couldnt get the Nibble domain so we went with the other one.</p>

<p>On the other hand,I felt the gap between the industry or research is growing wider and wider. What i read on the internet or herd from people who are not in this College,often is an alien language to people here.</p>
<p>So we can say it is a “Translater”, for the Klingon the Industry speaks. </p>

<h2 id="Our-Journey-so-far"><a href="#Our-Journey-so-far" class="headerlink" title="Our Journey so far"></a>Our Journey so far</h2><p>We started with beta edition of website .</p>
<p><a href="https://nybles.github.io/adam/" target="_blank" rel="external">View Old website</a> <a href="https://github.com/nybles/adam" target="_blank" rel="external">Code on Github</a></p>
<p>The website was based on Jekyll. Adding an article was tedious since it required one to send a Pull request. Even though the team developed an  <a href="https://nybles.github.io/markdown-editor/" target="_blank" rel="external">editor</a> to make it with ease people still found it hard.</p>
<p><img src="https://preview.ibb.co/hgUfpv/old.png" alt="beta website"></p>
<p>== Closing in on Quantum Computing<br>12 Mar 2017<br>By Elaine Mary Rose - 7 min read ==</p>
<p>Was the first article to be published on the beta version.<br>During revamp we are only taking the top 5 articles based on Google Analytics to the new platform.</p>
<p>So after 5 months on the same date we are releasing  version 1.0.</p>
<p>We are making some changes during this auspicious time</p>
<h3 id="New-website"><a href="#New-website" class="headerlink" title="New website :"></a>New website :</h3><p>The new website will be served on Ghost.org . </p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/clgzYtpZr7SPS/giphy.gif" alt="Website"></p>
<p><strong>Why Ghost?</strong></p>
<p>We wanted</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazing admin panel</li>
<li>Quick integration with API’s such as slack,facebook comments etc.</li>
<li>Markdown </li>
<li>You can checkout its cool other features at <a href="ghost.org">Ghost.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We were using Jekyll till now, but sending pr for articles takes too much effort and learning curve for every new writer was high.</p>
<p>Our development goal is new develop new theme for Ghost which will suit our needs.</p>
<h3 id="Chatbot"><a href="#Chatbot" class="headerlink" title="Chatbot :"></a>Chatbot :</h3><p>We also developed a chat bot which you can talk to via our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nyblenews" target="_blank" rel="external">facebook page</a></p>

<h3 id="Articles"><a href="#Articles" class="headerlink" title="Articles"></a>Articles</h3><ul>
<li>We plan to release an article within three days </li>
<li>We would send a newsletter to everyone subscribed in every 15 or 30 days.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Future-Plans"><a href="#Future-Plans" class="headerlink" title="Future Plans"></a>Future Plans</h3><ul>
<li>Mobile App to be developed using react native, Probable date of release October 2017.</li>
<li>Better integration of WebApp and Chatbot.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll be stepping down from the position of Editor in Cheif from this edition. As the team is amazing now and Nybles is now live. Now ill search for another problem to solve and find my place in the Universe. </p>

<p>This years Hack In the North had around 300 participants to become india’s biggest student held Hackathon, With participants coming from all over india to make the event a grand sucess.</p>
<h1 id="Team"><a href="#Team" class="headerlink" title="Team"></a>Team</h1><div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2819/32862646223_532ce4c81c_b.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>We decided early on that this year , there wont be any main organiser or anything of such sorts. Everyone will be the same and all will have equal role. This was a vital part for the event.So with a linear management we started preparing for the even 8 months prior to the event.</p>
<p>The team page of the event can be seen at <a href="https://www.hackinthenorth.com/team.html" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a></p>
<h1 id="Marketing"><a href="#Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Marketing"></a>Marketing</h1><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEt7be-ZIsc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>As marketing is the most vital part of making every event a sucess. This year we decided to redefine everything by changing the logo and realsed two trailers for the event. Design for everything including the posters , website etc was be minimal.</p>
<h1 id="Registartion"><a href="#Registartion" class="headerlink" title="Registartion"></a>Registartion</h1><p>We opened the registartion months prior to the event , so that students who are far off would get sufficent time to prepare for the event. Participants were shortlisted by their GitHub profile and Resume. Hack In the North is free for everyone although we donot provide travel rembiustments we do provide free accomodation, food and other facilities during the event.</p>
<h1 id="The-Opening-Cermony"><a href="#The-Opening-Cermony" class="headerlink" title="The Opening Cermony"></a>The Opening Cermony</h1><div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3854/33506805541_d4aa846341_b.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>The opening cermony was made special by talks given by Joe Nash of GitHub, Sidarth of Startup Village, Saynthan of Fedora. During this 3 hour cermony particpants were briefed about the everything. </p>
<h1 id="The-Hacking"><a href="#The-Hacking" class="headerlink" title="The Hacking"></a>The Hacking</h1><p>Hacking started shortly after the opening cermony and particpants were split between two labs in Computer Center 3 of IIIT Allahabad Campus.Where at which the participants hacked contiously for the next 36 hours to decide who is the winner of the event. Each Team was assigned a table number and they were also provided with beddings inside the labs as well, for those who wanted to take rest. During the hacking online sessions of RestDB and other were held.</p>

<h1 id="Goodies"><a href="#Goodies" class="headerlink" title="Goodies"></a>Goodies</h1><p>Paticpants were all given T shirts, Stickers by various sponsors , Coupons for services ( such as restdb, digital ocean, Radix etc) and various other goodies. Online session by RestDB was also held during the event.</p>
<h1 id="Judging"><a href="#Judging" class="headerlink" title="Judging"></a>Judging</h1><p>Judging of the event was done using MIT’s gavel online judge. Our two judges were from Fedora and NASDAQ. The top 10 particpants where shortlisted from the 48 teams and they were called upon on the stage for final presentation. Based on the final presentation the winners of the event was decided. Prizes were given for Winners, Best hardware hack, Best radix hack and top 10 teams. </p>

<p>Winners of hint 2.0 during the final judging</p>
<h1 id="Sponsors"><a href="#Sponsors" class="headerlink" title="Sponsors"></a>Sponsors</h1><p>It was my third time organising a hackthon, first two although being sucessful was incomplete. It lacked an integral part, Sponsors. We had Github, Hackster.io, Gitlab, Radix, Wolframalpha, Tensorflow, Restdb and many more to fill that gapping hole this year. </p>

<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossiiita/opencode/master/Logo.png" alt=""></div>
<p>As the new year dawned, we decided to do something different. The issue we faced was that only few people were interested in Open Source, and we had to lure them into our little cult. Hence, inspired from GSOC and GCI, we decided to organise an event named Opencode. The idea was slightly absurd - a month long event where we help participants develop Open Source software on <a href="https://github.com/fossiiita" target="_blank" rel="external">GitHub</a>. <a href="https://fossiiita.github.io/opencodecollab/index.html#mentors" target="_blank" rel="external">My team</a>, consisting of Shubham Padia, Diwakar Vinay, Faheem Hassan Zunjani, Abhinav Khare, Pranjal Paliwal, Mubaris Hassan, Himanshu Shekhar and I, started working on 6 different projects as mentors.</p>
<h1 id="The-beginning"><a href="#The-beginning" class="headerlink" title="The beginning"></a>The beginning</h1><p>The event timeline.</p>
<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossiiita/opencode/master/timeline.png" alt=""></div>
<p>Since the event was a farely new idea we wanted to increase the hype so on new years we posted , comming soon posters.</p>
<p>Followed by that we published the trailer and accouned the event date.<br><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qkt9vMKYHAM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>
<p>we even made a simple markdown based <a href="https://fossiiita.github.io/opencode/" target="_blank" rel="external">website</a> for the event.</p>
<h1 id="Selected-Projects"><a href="#Selected-Projects" class="headerlink" title="Selected Projects"></a>Selected Projects</h1><h2 id="Opencodecollab"><a href="#Opencodecollab" class="headerlink" title="Opencodecollab"></a><a href="https://fossiiita.github.io/opencodecollab/" target="_blank" rel="external">Opencodecollab</a></h2><p><a href="https://github.com/fossiiita/opencodecollab" target="_blank" rel="external">View on github</a> <a href="https://fossiiita.github.io/opencodecollab/" target="_blank" rel="external">View Website</a> </p>
<p>Opencode Collabrative website</p>
<p>This is was our main project, to participate in the event a user had to send a pull request adding his name in this website (Made using jeykll). Thanks to github for making the amazing jeykll project.</p>
<p>At the beginning the the website only had students and participants sections. </p>
<p>New features :</p>
<ul>
<li>Card flip to show details.</li>
<li>Increased number of projects from two to six.</li>
<li>Added projects section which uses github api to fetch number of stars and forks each repo has.</li>
<li>Added participant projects consisting of javascript games made by them.</li>
<li>Added participant blogs describing each persons experince during the event.</li>
<li>Issues section which fetched all projects with label opencode and displayed them in the website.</li>
<li>Loader for the website, Better background images, Watch trailer and facebook likes , share and changed facebook graph images.</li>
<li>Chat box inside the website (gitter) , Countdown for the event and event scoreboard to view each persons commits.</li>
</ul>
<p>The event had a total of 66 participants out of which 63 where from IIIT- Allahabad.</p>
<h2 id="Humbefoolcup"><a href="#Humbefoolcup" class="headerlink" title="Humbefoolcup"></a><a href="https://fossiiita.github.io/humblefoolcup/" target="_blank" rel="external">Humbefoolcup</a></h2><p>Humbefoolcup was an event page which we made using materilizecss.<br>It started of with a simple materilizecss template. In the end we made :</p>
<ul>
<li>A compelete event page </li>
<li>A <a href="https://fossiiita.github.io/humblefoolcup/humblefool/humblefool.html" target="_blank" rel="external">tribute page</a>, stats page and team page.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the contributions was from the participants i only managed the page with the help of Diwakar. </p>
<h2 id="Other-projects"><a href="#Other-projects" class="headerlink" title="Other projects"></a>Other projects</h2><p>Other projects can be viewed at the projects section at opencodecollab website .</p>
<p>To increase the Participants we also conducted workshops on Git | Github and Android game Dev during the event.</p>
<h1 id="Conslusion"><a href="#Conslusion" class="headerlink" title="Conslusion"></a>Conslusion</h1><p>In the beginning, the event attracted only few participants. But the number increased gradually, and as the event came to an end, we reached 66 participants with most of them from IIIT Allahabad. Together we created amazing things.</p>
<p>As compared to normal GCI which has around 100-150 participants we need a lot more participants to call it a huge succes , but for the first time this was considered to be fair. As our number of mentors, publicity and prize money was limited.</p>
<p>Things to improve :</p>
<ul>
<li>Participants had limited knowledge projects that required different skills were not much touched , which was a big draw back. Such as Android App, Django based projects etc. </li>
<li>Bigger prize money and sponsors. </li>
<li>Larger reach , we need to extend the event to other colleges as well. Our target next time is to reach out to colleges which are far off so that they will also get to know more about opensource.</li>
<li>More mentors.</li>
</ul>
<p>But overall it was one of the best one months i had in my B-Tech mentoring other students.Its all becasue of the Opencode team ,small but amazing for making it a success.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading :) </p>

<h2 id="The-Trip"><a href="#The-Trip" class="headerlink" title="The Trip"></a>The Trip</h2><h2 id="How-to-Reach"><a href="#How-to-Reach" class="headerlink" title="How to Reach?"></a>How to Reach?</h2><p>To reach Rishikesh you have to first reach Haridwar or Dehradun. We reached Haridwar by train after realizing there is nothing much to do there we took a bus to Rishikesh. Which took almost 1.25 hours and is available 24 * 7 . You can also get Taxi’s or Auto’s.</p>
<h2 id="Camping"><a href="#Camping" class="headerlink" title="Camping"></a>Camping</h2><p>After reaching we took a river side camp in Shivpuri near Rishikesh for the nights stay. The package included food,camping and free rafting on the next day.Food was great and nothing can ever match the ambiance of the atmosphere though. The Bon fire with with the cold winds from the Himalayas are something worth experiencing.</p>
<p>We had to wake up early in the morning to go for river rafting.</p>
<h2 id="Rafting"><a href="#Rafting" class="headerlink" title="Rafting"></a>Rafting</h2><p>River <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafting" target="_blank" rel="external">Rafting</a> is one of the cheapest and most amazing things to do in Rishikesh.<br>We did a 18 km rafting which included few grade 3 and grade 4 Rapids. Being at the front of the raft i had an interesting journey.<br>During rafting they allow us to jump into River Ganges and do body floating(with their life jackets on). Which is basically the only time non swimmers can actually experience the beauty of the sport without putting in any effort(P.S i can swim). We stopped half way during the ride for a Tea break where people could do Cliff jumping , which is basically people jumping from a rock into the water. After which we rowed to the end point and finished our ride.</p>
<h2 id="Bungee"><a href="#Bungee" class="headerlink" title="Bungee"></a>Bungee</h2><p>The main purpose of this trip was to do Bungee Jumping at <a href="http://www.jumpinheights.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Jumpin heights</a> which is an 83 meters long India’s highest jump with jump masters from New Zealand .<br>It costs around Rs 3600 for a jump which is same everywhere , so you dont have to roam around finding people to bargain with. It is of top quality and is worth every single penny of it. The Jumping place is around 20 km away from Rishikesh which rented a bike for the travel.</p>
<p>After the jump we have to do a small trek up the mountain we just jumped . The place also has Flying Fox and Giant Swing.</p>
<h2 id="BeatlesAshram"><a href="#BeatlesAshram" class="headerlink" title="BeatlesAshram"></a>BeatlesAshram</h2><p>Beatles Ashram is the place where the infamous Beatles stayed when they came to India. This is place is full of Graffiti and paintings which will make the artist within you fall in love.</p>
<p>Well that was a lot wasn’t it. There are more but i got tired of clicking pics. There are small caves and very old ashrams there also.</p>
<h2 id="Others"><a href="#Others" class="headerlink" title="Others"></a>Others</h2><p>There are many more interesting places like Ram Jhula, Lakshman Jhula , Triveni Ghat and many temples in Rishikesh too.But this post wont cover them.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading and i hope one day you will also visit there and try out everything.</p>

<p><a href="https://iiitahacks.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">IIITA Hacks</a> was organized as part of Technical Society from 10th to 11th September 2016. It was a 17 hour hackathon with a participation of 150 students from the Institute.</p>
<p>IIITA Hacks was an exclusive for the students of Indian Institute of Information Technology,Allahabad ,serving for the purpose for increasing the hackathon culture in the Institute.

<p>Even the term Hackathon was a new one for a lot of people in Allahabad. If i had a penny for every time i herd what is a Hackathon i would be a very rich guy. But even in this situation we made it happen. And i am proud of being part of this wonderful team.<br>It was held as part of our tech fest Aparoksha and beginning itself it was decided it would be our flagship event.Due to the support from our sponsors Hackerearth , Mozilla and our faculty we raised enough funds to make it happen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hackinthenorth.com/2016/" target="_blank" rel="external">View website</a></p>
<p>All the participants had to do was take the first train to Allahabad with your laptop and we will provide you everything you want to hack . Participant were provided accommodation , food , T shirts and goodies :).</p>
<div class="figure fig-50" style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="http://i.imgsafe.org/3a66fa6f00.jpg" alt=""></div>
<div class="figure fig-50" style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="http://i.imgsafe.org/3a670e2cd5.jpg" alt=""></div>
<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="http://i.imgsafe.org/3a6e4316d3.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>We had more than 140 participants from all over India and most of them traveled at least 500 Kms. While talking to them i learned a lot about the things that are happening all over India. And watching them develop truly magnificent peaces of “art” (What they made looked like art) made me realize how much i can achieve in 3 days . And most of them taught me the valuable lesson of how to approach to a particular solution.</p>
<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="http://i.imgsafe.org/3a6b51c1c8.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>Our judge Hackerearth CTO Vivek Prakash said he had never seen a student held Hackathon like this before and said<br><div class="alert success"><p>“Hack in the north is India’s biggest student held Hackathon “ </p>
</div>truly made all of our in the team happy. Receiving this much recognition even in our first run.</p>
<div class="figure fig-50" style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="http://i.imgsafe.org/3a6e1a7b13.jpg" alt=""></div>
<div class="figure fig-50" style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="http://i.imgsafe.org/3a6e07b03e.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>The winners of the Hackathon made Castle Defence : Multiplayer game and generic android controller. They were really cool guys from MNIT Allahabad. I even saw them changing and adapting to the situation and in the end it all worked out well. I guess its all about perseverance, adaptability and hard-work. After all commitment is what transforms a promise into reality .All of the teams attended in the event were truly exceptional and our team wanted to give prices to all of them but right now they have to settle with t shirts.</p>
<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="2.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>This experience was an amazing one for me and it wouldn’t have been so great without our team making it possible. I hope we can make next years Hackathon an even better one. I am sure we can with this team.</p>
