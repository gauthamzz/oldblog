<p>Technically CycleGAN gives you epic results <a href="https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/" target="_blank" rel="external">like</a></p>
 <div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN/raw/master/imgs/horse2zebra.gif" alt=""></div>
<p>The code written so bad that it gave images like these.</p>
<div class="figure fig-50" style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="image11.png" alt=""></div><div class="figure fig-50" style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="image8.gif" alt=""></div><div class="figure fig-50" style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="image9.gif" alt=""></div>
<p>Well not all were bad, but some are pretty awful.</p>
<p>So to put use of my slow laptop, i decided to apply the idea in another domain. Apply on sounds.</p>
<p>Wait wait….</p>
<p>Lets look at cycleGan first<br><div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="image6.png" alt=""></div></p>
<p>Basic idea is you have image of one style ,you copy that style to another(Yeah like the Prisma APP which was so viral and you dowanloaded it then and you forgot to delete it. Now its just wasting space in your mobile device).</p>
<p>Cool thing is you only need unpaired image samples. So google some stuff copy some images and you have a dataset. </p>
<p>If you wanna know more read the paper. In short it has a cyclic loss with the Adversarial loss.</p>
<h1 id="Our-Tweak"><a href="#Our-Tweak" class="headerlink" title="Our Tweak"></a>Our Tweak</h1><p>Lets convert audio to image and apply the same thing. </p>
<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="image15.png" alt=""></div>
<p>So i did it on greyscale. Yes im too impatient to wait for an RGB to train to see if a hypothesis works.</p>
<p>So we took 20 second audio and converted to Greysacle image and applied CycleGAN.</p>
<p>We got this.</p>
<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="image16.png" alt=""></div>
<p>a) Style 1<br>b) Style 2 applied on Style 1<br>c) Style 2<br>d) Style 1 applied on Style 2</p>
<p>Turns out the unpaired image thing is pretty sweet.</p>
<h1 id="Results"><a href="#Results" class="headerlink" title="Results"></a>Results</h1><p>Style 1 </p>
<audio src="media2.wav" controls preload=""></audio>

<p>Style 2 applied on Style 1</p>
<audio src="media3.wav" controls preload=""></audio>

<p>Style 2</p>
<audio src="media4.wav" controls preload=""></audio>

<p>Style 1 applied on Style 2</p>
<audio src="media5.wav" controls preload=""></audio>

<p>Yesh the second one sounds fine and fourth one ripped your ear off.</p>
<p>I was too lazy to convert and see it works all the time.</p>
<p>Well it gets good at some point of training then it starts producing results which will rip your ear off again.</p>
<p>Yaay good news,its works. </p>
<p>If you make a better network it will give you better results and maybe apply some noise filter.<br>Ah! ill do that another day. </p>
<p>Now look at this epic tiget to panther conversion. </p>
<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="image3.gif" alt=""></div><div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="image2.gif" alt=""></div>

Why not any other name</h1><p>Nybles or Nibble is a unit of information. 4 bits or 0.5 byte is a Nibble or a Nyble. Well we couldnt get the Nibble domain so we went with the other one.</p>

Why not a general college newletter?</h1><p>IIIT Allahabad is a small college,information is can travel quickly via word of mouth over here.</p>
<p>On the other hand,I felt the gap between the industry or research is growing wider and wider. What i read on the internet or herd from people who are not in this College,often is an alien language to people here.</p>
<p>So we can say it is a “Translater”, for the Klingon the Industry speaks. </p>

<h2 id="Our-Journey-so-far"><a href="#Our-Journey-so-far" class="headerlink" title="Our Journey so far"></a>Our Journey so far</h2><p>We started with beta edition of website .</p>
<p><a href="https://nybles.github.io/adam/" target="_blank" rel="external">View Old website</a> <a href="https://github.com/nybles/adam" target="_blank" rel="external">Code on Github</a></p>
<p>The website was based on Jekyll. Adding an article was tedious since it required one to send a Pull request. Even though the team developed an  <a href="https://nybles.github.io/markdown-editor/" target="_blank" rel="external">editor</a> to make it with ease people still found it hard.</p>
<p><img src="https://preview.ibb.co/hgUfpv/old.png" alt="beta website"></p>
<p>== Closing in on Quantum Computing<br>12 Mar 2017<br>By Elaine Mary Rose - 7 min read ==</p>
<p>Was the first article to be published on the beta version.<br>During revamp we are only taking the top 5 articles based on Google Analytics to the new platform.</p>
<p>So after 5 months on the same date we are releasing  version 1.0.</p>
<p>We are making some changes during this auspicious time</p>
<h3 id="New-website"><a href="#New-website" class="headerlink" title="New website :"></a>New website :</h3><p>The new website will be served on Ghost.org . </p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/clgzYtpZr7SPS/giphy.gif" alt="Website"></p>
<p><strong>Why Ghost?</strong></p>
<p>We wanted</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazing admin panel</li>
<li>Quick integration with API’s such as slack,facebook comments etc.</li>
<li>Markdown </li>
<li>You can checkout its cool other features at <a href="ghost.org">Ghost.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We were using Jekyll till now, but sending pr for articles takes too much effort and learning curve for every new writer was high.</p>
<p>Our development goal is new develop new theme for Ghost which will suit our needs.</p>
<h3 id="Chatbot"><a href="#Chatbot" class="headerlink" title="Chatbot :"></a>Chatbot :</h3><p>We also developed a chat bot which you can talk to via our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nyblenews" target="_blank" rel="external">facebook page</a></p>

<h3 id="Articles"><a href="#Articles" class="headerlink" title="Articles"></a>Articles</h3><ul>
<li>We plan to release an article within three days </li>
<li>We would send a newsletter to everyone subscribed in every 15 or 30 days.</li>

<p>This years Hack In the North had around 300 participants to become india’s biggest student held Hackathon, With participants coming from all over india to make the event a grand sucess.</p>
<h1 id="Team"><a href="#Team" class="headerlink" title="Team"></a>Team</h1><div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2819/32862646223_532ce4c81c_b.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>We decided early on that this year , there wont be any main organiser or anything of such sorts. Everyone will be the same and all will have equal role. This was a vital part for the event.So with a linear management we started preparing for the even 8 months prior to the event.</p>
<p>The team page of the event can be seen at <a href="https://www.hackinthenorth.com/team.html" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a></p>
<h1 id="Marketing"><a href="#Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Marketing"></a>Marketing</h1><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEt7be-ZIsc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>As marketing is the most vital part of making every event a sucess. This year we decided to redefine everything by changing the logo and realsed two trailers for the event. Design for everything including the posters , website etc was be minimal.</p>
<h1 id="Registartion"><a href="#Registartion" class="headerlink" title="Registartion"></a>Registartion</h1><p>We opened the registartion months prior to the event , so that students who are far off would get sufficent time to prepare for the event. Participants were shortlisted by their GitHub profile and Resume. Hack In the North is free for everyone although we donot provide travel rembiustments we do provide free accomodation, food and other facilities during the event.</p>
<h1 id="The-Opening-Cermony"><a href="#The-Opening-Cermony" class="headerlink" title="The Opening Cermony"></a>The Opening Cermony</h1><div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3854/33506805541_d4aa846341_b.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>The opening cermony was made special by talks given by Joe Nash of GitHub, Sidarth of Startup Village, Saynthan of Fedora. During this 3 hour cermony particpants were briefed about the everything. </p>
<h1 id="The-Hacking"><a href="#The-Hacking" class="headerlink" title="The Hacking"></a>The Hacking</h1><p>Hacking started shortly after the opening cermony and particpants were split between two labs in Computer Center 3 of IIIT Allahabad Campus.Where at which the participants hacked contiously for the next 36 hours to decide who is the winner of the event. Each Team was assigned a table number and they were also provided with beddings inside the labs as well, for those who wanted to take rest. During the hacking online sessions of RestDB and other were held.</p>

<h1 id="Judging"><a href="#Judging" class="headerlink" title="Judging"></a>Judging</h1><p>Judging of the event was done using MIT’s gavel online judge. Our two judges were from Fedora and NASDAQ.

<h1 id="Sponsors"><a href="#Sponsors" class="headerlink" title="Sponsors"></a>Sponsors</h1><p>It was my third time organising a hackthon, first two although being sucessful was incomplete. It lacked an integral part, Sponsors. We had Github, Hackster.io, Gitlab, Radix, Wolframalpha, Tensorflow, Restdb and many more to fill that gapping hole this year. </p>

<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossiiita/opencode/master/Logo.png" alt=""></div>
<p>As the new year dawned, we decided to do something different. The issue we faced was that only few people were interested in Open Source, and we had to lure them into our little cult. Hence, inspired from GSOC and GCI, we decided to organise an event named Opencode. The idea was slightly absurd - a month long event where we help participants develop Open Source software on <a href="https://github.com/fossiiita" target="_blank" rel="external">GitHub</a>. <a href="https://fossiiita.github.io/opencodecollab/index.html#mentors" target="_blank" rel="external">My team</a>, consisting of Shubham Padia, Diwakar Vinay, Faheem Hassan Zunjani, Abhinav Khare, Pranjal Paliwal, Mubaris Hassan, Himanshu Shekhar and I, started working on 6 different projects as mentors.</p>
<h1 id="The-beginning"><a href="#The-beginning" class="headerlink" title="The beginning"></a>The beginning</h1><p>The event timeline.</p>
<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossiiita/opencode/master/timeline.png" alt=""></div>
<p>Since the event was a farely new idea we wanted to increase the hype so on new years we posted , comming soon posters.</p>
<p>Followed by that we published the trailer and accouned the event date.<br><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qkt9vMKYHAM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>
<p>we even made a simple markdown based <a href="https://fossiiita.github.io/opencode/" target="_blank" rel="external">website</a> for the event.</p>
<h1 id="Selected-Projects"><a href="#Selected-Projects" class="headerlink" title="Selected Projects"></a>Selected Projects</h1><h2 id="Opencodecollab"><a href="#Opencodecollab" class="headerlink" title="Opencodecollab"></a><a href="https://fossiiita.github.io/opencodecollab/" target="_blank" rel="external">Opencodecollab</a></h2><p><a href="https://github.com/fossiiita/opencodecollab" target="_blank" rel="external">View on github</a> <a href="https://fossiiita.github.io/opencodecollab/" target="_blank" rel="external">View Website</a> </p>
<p>Opencode Collabrative website</p>
<p>This is was our main project, to participate in the event a user had to send a pull request adding his name in this website (Made using jeykll). Thanks to github for making the amazing jeykll project.</p>
<p>At the beginning the the website only had students and participants sections. </p>
<p>New features :</p>
<ul>
<li>Card flip to show details.</li>
<li>Increased number of projects from two to six.</li>
<li>Added projects section which uses github api to fetch number of stars and forks each repo has.</li>
<li>Added participant projects consisting of javascript games made by them.</li>
<li>Added participant blogs describing each persons experince during the event.</li>
<li>Issues section which fetched all projects with label opencode and displayed them in the website.</li>
<li>Loader for the website, Better background images, Watch trailer and facebook likes , share and changed facebook graph images.</li>
<li>Chat box inside the website (gitter) , Countdown for the event and event scoreboard to view each persons commits.</li>
</ul>
<p>The event had a total of 66 participants out of which 63 where from IIIT- Allahabad.</p>
<h2 id="Humbefoolcup"><a href="#Humbefoolcup" class="headerlink" title="Humbefoolcup"></a><a href="https://fossiiita.github.io/humblefoolcup/" target="_blank" rel="external">Humbefoolcup</a></h2><p>Humbefoolcup was an event page which we made using materilizecss.<br>It started of with a simple materilizecss template. In the end we made :</p>
<ul>
<li>A compelete event page </li>
<li>A <a href="https://fossiiita.github.io/humblefoolcup/humblefool/humblefool.html" target="_blank" rel="external">tribute page</a>, stats page and team page.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the contributions was from the participants i only managed the page with the help of Diwakar. </p>
<h2 id="Other-projects"><a href="#Other-projects" class="headerlink" title="Other projects"></a>Other projects</h2><p>Other projects can be viewed at the projects section at opencodecollab website .</p>
<p>To increase the Participants we also conducted workshops on Git | Github and Android game Dev during the event.</p>
<h1 id="Conslusion"><a href="#Conslusion" class="headerlink" title="Conslusion"></a>Conslusion</h1><p>In the beginning, the event attracted only few participants. But the number increased gradually, and as the event came to an end, we reached 66 participants with most of them from IIIT Allahabad. Together we created amazing things.</p>
<p>As compared to normal GCI which has around 100-150 participants we need a lot more participants to call it a huge succes , but for the first time this was considered to be fair. As our number of mentors, publicity and prize money was limited.</p>
<p>Things to improve :</p>
<ul>
<li>Participants had limited knowledge projects that required different skills were not much touched , which was a big draw back. Such as Android App, Django based projects etc. </li>
<li>Bigger prize money and sponsors. </li>
<li>Larger reach , we need to extend the event to other colleges as well. Our target next time is to reach out to colleges which are far off so that they will also get to know more about opensource.</li>
<li>More mentors.</li>
</ul>
<p>But overall it was one of the best one months i had in my B-Tech mentoring other students.Its all becasue of the Opencode team ,small but amazing for making it a success.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading :) </p>

<h2 id="The-Trip"><a href="#The-Trip" class="headerlink" title="The Trip"></a>The Trip</h2><h2 id="How-to-Reach"><a href="#How-to-Reach" class="headerlink" title="How to Reach?"></a>How to Reach?</h2><p>To reach Rishikesh you have to first reach Haridwar or Dehradun. We reached Haridwar by train after realizing there is nothing much to do there we took a bus to Rishikesh. Which took almost 1.25 hours and is available 24 * 7 . You can also get Taxi’s or Auto’s.</p>
<h2 id="Camping"><a href="#Camping" class="headerlink" title="Camping"></a>Camping</h2><p>After reaching we took a river side camp in Shivpuri near Rishikesh for the nights stay. The package included food,camping and free rafting on the next day.Food was great and nothing can ever match the ambiance of the atmosphere though. The Bon fire with with the cold winds from the Himalayas are something worth experiencing.</p>
<p>We had to wake up early in the morning to go for river rafting.</p>
<h2 id="Rafting"><a href="#Rafting" class="headerlink" title="Rafting"></a>Rafting</h2><p>River <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafting" target="_blank" rel="external">Rafting</a> is one of the cheapest and most amazing things to do in Rishikesh.<br>We did a 18 km rafting which included few grade 3 and grade 4 Rapids. Being at the front of the raft i had an interesting journey.<br>During rafting they allow us to jump into River Ganges and do body floating(with their life jackets on). Which is basically the only time non swimmers can actually experience the beauty of the sport without putting in any effort(P.S i can swim). We stopped half way during the ride for a Tea break where people could do Cliff jumping , which is basically people jumping from a rock into the water. After which we rowed to the end point and finished our ride.</p>
<h2 id="Bungee"><a href="#Bungee" class="headerlink" title="Bungee"></a>Bungee</h2><p>The main purpose of this trip was to do Bungee Jumping at <a href="http://www.jumpinheights.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Jumpin heights</a> which is an 83 meters long India’s highest jump with jump masters from New Zealand .<br>It costs around Rs 3600 for a jump which is same everywhere , so you dont have to roam around finding people to bargain with. It is of top quality and is worth every single penny of it. The Jumping place is around 20 km away from Rishikesh which rented a bike for the travel.</p>
<p>After the jump we have to do a small trek up the mountain we just jumped . The place also has Flying Fox and Giant Swing.</p>
<h2 id="BeatlesAshram"><a href="#BeatlesAshram" class="headerlink" title="BeatlesAshram"></a>BeatlesAshram</h2><p>Beatles Ashram is the place where the infamous Beatles stayed when they came to India. This is place is full of Graffiti and paintings which will make the artist within you fall in love.</p>
<p>Well that was a lot wasn’t it. There are more but i got tired of clicking pics. There are small caves and very old ashrams there also.</p>
<h2 id="Others"><a href="#Others" class="headerlink" title="Others"></a>Others</h2><p>There are many more interesting places like Ram Jhula, Lakshman Jhula , Triveni Ghat and many temples in Rishikesh too.But this post wont cover them.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading and i hope one day you will also visit there and try out everything.</p>

<p>Even the term Hackathon was a new one for a lot of people in Allahabad. If i had a penny for every time i herd what is a Hackathon i would be a very rich guy. But even in this situation we made it happen. And i am proud of being part of this wonderful team.<br>It was held as part of our tech fest Aparoksha and beginning itself it was decided it would be our flagship event.Due to the support from our sponsors Hackerearth , Mozilla and our faculty we raised enough funds to make it happen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hackinthenorth.com/2016/" target="_blank" rel="external">View website</a></p>
<p>All the participants had to do was take the first train to Allahabad with your laptop and we will provide you everything you want to hack . Participant were provided accommodation , food , T shirts and goodies :).</p>

<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="http://i.imgsafe.org/3a6e4316d3.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>We had more than 140 participants from all over India and most of them traveled at least 500 Kms. While talking to them i learned a lot about the things that are happening all over India. And watching them develop truly magnificent peaces of “art” (What they made looked like art) made me realize how much i can achieve in 3 days . And most of them taught me the valuable lesson of how to approach to a particular solution.</p>
<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="http://i.imgsafe.org/3a6b51c1c8.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>Our judge Hackerearth CTO Vivek Prakash said he had never seen a student held Hackathon like this before and said<br><div class="alert success"><p>“Hack in the north is India’s biggest student held Hackathon “ </p>
</div>truly made all of our in the team happy. Receiving this much recognition even in our first run.</p>
<div class="figure fig-50" style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="http://i.imgsafe.org/3a6e1a7b13.jpg" alt=""></div>
<div class="figure fig-50" style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="http://i.imgsafe.org/3a6e07b03e.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>The winners of the Hackathon made Castle Defence : Multiplayer game and generic android controller. They were really cool guys from MNIT Allahabad. I even saw them changing and adapting to the situation and in the end it all worked out well. I guess its all about perseverance, adaptability and hard-work. After all commitment is what transforms a promise into reality .All of the teams attended in the event were truly exceptional and our team wanted to give prices to all of them but right now they have to settle with t shirts.</p>
<div class="figure " style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="2.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>This experience was an amazing one for me and it wouldn’t have been so great without our team making it possible. I hope we can make next years Hackathon an even better one. I am sure we can with this team.</p>
